## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1 was an easy lab that focused on the basics of coding. This lab helped me by introducing the basics rather than diving headfirst. I had to figure out what line needed to be changed, so I can display "Hello Ernesto", a great introduction to this course.


* Lab 7, part 1 was my favorite because I was able to relate it to my daily life. For instance, part 1 was trying to see how much time elapsed by subtracting two different dates(months). If we wanted to, we could scale this down to track how many hours or minutes an individual has exercised for.

* Lab 8, part 1 was also my favorite because we utilized an if statement. We used the if statement to see whether an individual gave the following ingredients (protein, bread, and condiment). If the individual didn't provide us with enough arguments, the user would receive an error message stating "Insufficient amount Expected 3". This was my first introduction to if statements, lab 8 made it easier to understand this concept.
